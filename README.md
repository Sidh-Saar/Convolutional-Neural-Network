# Convolutional-Neural-Network

In this project, I used a convolutional neural network to detect cats and dogs in images! 

An executable .py file can be found for each model, along with a .ipynb file to visualize the model's results on the dataset. The Dataset is too large to upload to Github, so a link is provided to a google drive folder with the dataset! 


To speed up model training, Google Colab was used.

These projects were completed through a course on Udemy in July 2023 but were only added to GitHub recently.
